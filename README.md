# 🧭 DFH Consequence & Compliance Policy

## Global Enforcement Framework for the Semantic Stack & Deterministic First-Hop (DFH)

**Status:** Open Specification  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**License:** MIT

---

> **Shape breaks → determinism breaks**  
> **Determinism breaks → grounding breaks**  
> **Grounding breaks → authority collapses**

This repository defines the **official compliance, validation, and consequence model** for the **DFH (Deterministic First-Hop) Semantic Stack**.

* **Non‑criminal:** No legal, financial, or punitive enforcement  \
* **Protocol‑level only:** Consequences emerge from loss of trust and resolution  \
* **Deterministic:** If the required shape is broken, compliant systems must ignore it

The DFH / Semantic Stack only functions if **all participants adhere to the same structural contract**.

---

## 0. Scope

These rules apply to any implementation of:

* The **Semantic Stack** concept  \
* The **DFH (Deterministic First‑Hop)** mechanism  \
* The **`/.well-known/stack`** descriptor  \
* The **Five Anchors**: `type`, `entity`, `url`, `sitemap`, `canonical`  \
* DFH‑aware tooling (validators, generators, installers)  \
* Domain‑level or topic‑level semantic roots built on this specification

This document defines:

* **Mandatory compliance requirements**  \
* **Deterministic consequences of non‑compliance**  \
* **Failure modes** at both domain and ecosystem scale

---

## 1. Hard Requirements (Compliance Contract)

To be considered **DFH / Semantic Stack compliant**, an implementation **MUST** satisfy *all* of the following requirements.

---

### 1.1 Stack Descriptor Location

A valid DFH stack descriptor **MUST** be published at:

```
/.well-known/stack
```

The descriptor **MUST** be a valid **JSON‑LD** document.

---

### 1.2 Required Anchors (Normative)

The top‑level object **MUST** expose **exactly** the following five anchors, spelled **exactly** as shown:

```json
{
  "type": "…",
  "entity": "…",
  "url": "…",
  "sitemap": "…",
  "canonical": "…"
}
```

**Rules:**

* Keys are **case‑sensitive**  \
* Anchors **MUST** be **top‑level**  \
* Anchors **MUST NOT** be renamed, aliased, or nested

If **any** required anchor is missing, renamed, or structurally altered, the stack is **non‑compliant**.

---

### 1.3 Structural Stability

A compliant stack **MUST** maintain:

* Stable key names  \
* Stable document shape  \
* Valid JSON‑LD semantics

A compliant stack **MUST NOT**:

* Reorder anchors into nested objects  \
* Introduce incompatible schema variations  \
* Mix unrelated or conflicting semantic data

> **Determinism requires predictable structure.**

---

### 1.4 Naming & Protocol Integrity

Implementations **MUST NOT**:

* Rename **DFH**, the **Semantic Stack**, or the **Five Anchors**  \
* Create “DFH‑but‑different” variants  \
* Publish incompatible “v2” or alternative first‑hop protocols under the DFH name

Forks are permitted **only** if they **do not claim DFH compliance**.

> **If you change the contract, you have exited DFH.**

---

## 2. Consequence Model (Protocol‑Only)

There is **no central authority**, **no enforcement body**, and **no punishment**.

Compliance is enforced entirely through **resolution and trust**.

If a system cannot deterministically rely on your stack, it **must ignore it**.

---

### 2.1 Consequence Types

#### Local (Per‑Domain)

* Stack marked **non‑compliant** by validators  \
* DFH resolvers reject the descriptor  \
* AI and search systems skip the domain for grounding  \
* DFH‑based topic authority and ranking advantages are lost

#### Network‑Level (If Non‑Compliance Is Widespread)

* Deterministic first‑hop resolution degrades  \
* Conflicting interpretations emerge  \
* AI systems revert to probabilistic guessing  \
* The Semantic Stack is treated as **noise**, not **signal**

---

## 3. Deterministic Rule‑Break Outcomes

### 3.1 Renaming Anchors

**Example violations:**

* `entity` → `id`  \
* `type` → `kind`

**Result:**

* Required anchors are missing  \
* Validators mark the stack invalid  \
* AI / search tools ignore the descriptor

**Why:**

Anchor names are **contract keys**, not labels.  
Change the keys → break the contract → lose determinism.

---

### 3.2 Omitting or Restructuring Anchors

**Example violations:**

* Removing `sitemap`  \
* Nesting `canonical`  \
* Publishing only partial anchors

**Result:**

* Shape becomes unpredictable  \
* Multi‑agent resolution disagrees  \
* DFH systems downgrade or ignore the stack

**Why:**

Determinism requires **complete and stable shape**.

---

### 3.3 Domain & TLD Alignment (Observed Web Reality)

**Important clarification:**

DFH **does not assign or mandate TLDs**.  
DFH **inherits the authoritative domain conventions that already exist on the public web**.

**Observed reality:**

* `.com` dominates global commercial entities and generic topics  \
* `.org` dominates institutions and nonprofits  \
* `.gov` dominates government authorities

DFH **records** this reality — it does **not redefine** it.

**Example violations:**

* Claiming global topic authority for `Cars` on `cars.xyz`  \
* Publishing `topic.ai` while `topic.com` is widely established

**Result:**

* DFH systems treat the domain as **non‑authoritative**  \
* Convention‑aligned domains are preferred  \
* The claim fails **silently**

**Why:**

Deterministic first‑hop resolution requires **collision avoidance**.  
Ignoring existing web conventions introduces ambiguity and breaks resolution.

> DFH does **not** ban other TLDs.  
> DFH does **not** block innovation.  
> DFH does **not** mandate `.com`.

**Rule:**

> The semantic root should live on the same domain that already represents the entity to the world.

---

### 3.4 Fragmenting the Pillars (Governance Rule)

The DFH ecosystem relies on stable, recognizable roots:

* Concept root  \
* Specification root  \
* Installation guidance  \
* Tooling and validators

If these are fragmented, renamed, or split into incompatible structures:

* Tooling cannot reliably reference the standard  \
* Implementers cannot identify the authoritative spec  \
* Adoption confidence collapses

> This is a **governance requirement**, not a wire‑format rule.

---

### 3.5 Breaking JSON‑LD Semantics

**Violations:**

* Removing required `@context` or `@type`  \
* Invalid JSON‑LD structure  \
* Arbitrary semantic mixing

**Result:**

* Parsers fail  \
* Graph resolution fails  \
* Stack ignored

JSON‑LD is the **interoperability layer**.  
If it breaks, grounding breaks.

---

### 3.6 Forking the DFH Protocol

**Violations:**

* “DFH2” with incompatible anchors  \
* Parallel first‑hop standards claiming DFH lineage

**Result:**

* Ecosystem fragmentation  \
* No single deterministic entry point  \
* AI systems revert to probabilistic grounding

> DFH is analogous to DNS: **one shared system or none**.

---

## 4. Failure Models

### 4.1 Local Failure

If only your domain violates the rules:

* Your stack is ignored  \
* You lose topic authority  \
* Compliant competitors gain advantage

> You harm only yourself.

---

### 4.2 Network Failure

If violations become widespread:

* DFH loses trust  \
* Vendors abandon deterministic grounding  \
* The ecosystem collapses back to heuristic crawling

> You harm the entire system.

---

## 5. Why the Rules Are Strict

DFH derives its power from:

* **Universality** — one first‑hop per topic  \
* **Determinism** — same anchors, same shape  \
* **Simplicity** — minimal surface area  \
* **Decentralization** — anyone can publish, under one contract  \
* **Stability** — shipped contracts do not drift

> Changing the contract is not customization — **it is exit**.

---

## 6. Enforcement (How It Actually Happens)

There is **no court**, **no appeals**, **no negotiation**.

Enforcement occurs through **code and consumption**.

**Validators:**

* Mark non‑compliance  \
* Emit machine‑readable errors

**AI / Search Systems:**

* Skip non‑compliant stacks  \
* Remove DFH‑based authority signals

**Ecosystem Tools:**

* Exclude invalid roots from topic graphs

> You are not punished.  
> You are simply **not trusted**.

---

## 7. Minimal Compliant Example

```json
{
  "@context": "https://example.org/dfh/context",
  "@type": "DFHStackRoot",
  "type": "Topic",
  "entity": "Cars",
  "url": "https://cars.com/",
  "sitemap": "https://cars.com/sitemap.xml",
  "canonical": "https://cars.com/"
}
```

Any deviation in **naming**, **structure**, or **domain alignment** renders this **non‑compliant**.

---

## 8. Validator Guidance (Non‑Normative)

Example validation logic:

* **RULE 1:** `/.well-known/stack` MUST exist and be valid JSON‑LD  \
* **RULE 2:** Required anchors MUST exist exactly as defined  \
* **RULE 3:** Domain MUST align with established web conventions  \
* **RULE 4:** No conflicting DFH variants may be present  \
* **RULE 5:** Violations → `status = non_compliant` + reason code

---

## 9. Summary

* Break naming → break determinism  \
* Break determinism → break grounding  \
* Break grounding → break authority

**DFH works because the contract is strict.**

You may do anything you want with your domain.  
You may **not** break the contract and still call it **DFH‑compliant**.
